# EVE1

This was the first pilot study for EVE. It was designed to run a program that could both run an experiment and analyse data from the experiment. This project has since been halted, so the code is not finalised.

It has a GUI that allows you to determine which way to run the program, as well as walking you through the steps.


The experiment portion was designed to play a series of passages and record the camera, which was watching an audiometer as the participant manipulated the sound volume.

The analysis portion took the recordings and employed optical character recognition (OCR) that read each frame's audiometer reading. This was improved over time, and now it just reads the frames when they are mid-change between one number and the next.

## WARNING
This program likely will not run correctly due to missing files. If you would like to see how it works, please reach out to me.
